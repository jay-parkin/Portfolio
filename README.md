</br>

## About

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio website. I'm Jason Parkin, and I'm looking to pursue a career in the world of web development. This site is basically my digital resume, where I showcase all the cool stuff I've learned and created along the way.

But hey, I'm not just passionate about code. I believe there's more to me than just technical skills, you'll also get a peek into what makes me tick outside of the tech world.

## Purpose

As mentioned earlier, the aim of this website is to create a portfolio showcasing my abilities as web developer. It will not only showcase the skills I've acquired through my Coder Academy bootcamp and previous learning experiences but also offer insights into my personal experiences beyond coding.

The anticipated audience for my website includes recruiters and hiring managers seeking candidates for entry-level web development/engineering positions. Whether they are actively searching for potential hires or have come across my application for a specific role, this platform aims to provide them with a comprehensive understanding of my capabilities.

## Target Audience

My portfolio was specifically created to showcase my relevent skills for any recruiters/hiring managers.
This is ideally my first step into gaining a role of a web developer and will act as a sneak peak into what I bring to the table for those dev teams looking top notch talent.

The targetted audience is anyone looking for a entry level developer, whether they are actively searching or just so happen to stumble upon my application.

So, my portfolio is all about making their job easier by giving them a crystal clear view of what I'm all about; my skills, my passion for web development, and my hunger for growth in the field.
